# React Native Unhandled JS Exception: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access a property of an undefined object.  Specifically, the error message "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')" usually arises when you are trying to iterate over an array that hasn't been initialized or has not yet received data from an asynchronous operation.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs because the `data` array in the `MyComponent` component is accessed using the `.map()` method before it's populated with data from the API call.  During the initial render, `data` is `undefined`, hence the error.
